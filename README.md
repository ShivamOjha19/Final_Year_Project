# 🔬 Predicting Fluid Flow with Neural Networks

This project applies neural networks to solve fundamental 1D Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) related to fluid dynamics. It models and visualizes time-dependent solutions for:

- 🌀 1D Convection Equation  
- 🌊 1D Convection-Diffusion Equation  
- ⚡ Burgers’ Equation

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- Neural network-based PDE solver  
- Input-driven simulation: define initial & boundary conditions  
- Real-time graphing of fluid flow over time  
- Educational tool for learning SciML, CFD, and PINNs
